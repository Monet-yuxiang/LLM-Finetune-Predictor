Theoretical models suggest this shift could reduce CO2 emissions by 12 gigatons annually. For example, the International Energy Agency predicts solar capacity will grow from 720 GW in 2020 to 8,500 GW by 2050. This systemic change hinges on grid modernization and policy frameworks.\nQuestion: How much could CO2 emissions decrease annually by 2050 due to renewable energy adoption?"

This generational shift in natural geography threatens coastal communities with rising sea levels, potentially displacing millions by 2050. Medium-impact projections suggest a 0.5-meter rise globally, exacerbating flooding in vulnerable regions like Southeast Asia.\nQuestion: How much has the melting of Greenland's ice sheets accelerated in the past 20 years?\","
