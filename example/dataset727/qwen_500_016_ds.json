Senators, merchants, and laborers shared gossip, debated politics, and conducted business in these spaces. The baths also reflected Rome's engineering prowess, with advanced heating systems (hypocausts) and aqueducts supplying water.

Meanwhile, caste-based discrimination persists despite legal bans, affecting Dalits' access to housing and jobs.\nQuestion: Why did urbanization patterns in Bangladesh develop unevenly after 1971?"

This technological advancement has enabled urban growth and food security but has also led to marine ecosystem degradation along the Persian Gulf coastlines. The increased salinity and chemical discharges from brine are disrupting coral reefs and fish populations, while energy-intensive processes contribute to the region's high carbon footprint.\nQuestion: How did the proliferation of desalination technology impact marine ecosystems in the Persian Gulf?"

These dynasties fostered agricultural expansion through land grants to temples and Brahmins, leading to deforestation and the cultivation of new crops like sugarcane and cotton. The resulting surplus boosted trade networks, connecting South Asia to the Indian Ocean trade routes. By the 13th century, the Delhi Sultanate's centralized taxation system and introduction of cash crops further monetized the economy, while Persianate administrative practices streamlined revenue collection. This economic transformation laid the groundwork for later Mughal prosperity.\nQuestion: What was the significance of agricultural expansion and cash crop cultivation in medieval South Asia's economic growth?"

These innovations revolutionized agriculture, enabling the cultivation of heavier soils and increasing food production. The three-field crop rotation system also emerged, reducing fallow periods and boosting yields. These changes not only supported population growth but also freed labor for urban crafts and trade, fostering the rise of towns and a merchant class. Guilds formed to regulate trades, and universities began to appear, signaling a cultural shift toward learning and specialization.

Local elites often collaborated with foreign powers, deepening social divisions. The rise of nationalist movements, such as the Arab Revolt (1916-1918), further fragmented the region. These dynamics created a volatile mix of colonial domination, elite complicity, and popular resistance, reshaping Middle Eastern societies.\nQuestion: What were the main causes of the Arab Revolt during World War I?"

In Ecuador, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) became a powerful force, organizing nationwide protests and influencing constitutional reforms. Similarly, in Bolivia, the cocalero movement, led by Evo Morales, merged indigenous identity with labor activism, eventually propelling Morales to the presidency in 2006.
