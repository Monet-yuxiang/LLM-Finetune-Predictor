{"question": "Identify the correct explanation for why coral reefs in some regions are thriving despite rising ocean temperatures, while others are experiencing severe bleaching.", "choices": ["The thriving reefs have a higher concentration of zooxanthellae that are resistant to all temperature changes.", "Local upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich water mitigates thermal stress in certain reef ecosystems.", "Corals in thriving reefs have evolved thicker skeletons that block heat absorption.", "Pollution runoff in some areas provides additional nutrients that counteract temperature effects."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_biology"}
{"question": "Which statement is true about the practical implications of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in agriculture?", "choices": ["CRISPR-Cas9 can only be used to edit animal genomes, not plant genomes.", "CRISPR-Cas9 allows for precise modifications to crop genomes to enhance drought resistance.", "CRISPR-Cas9 edits are always permanent and cannot be reversed under any circumstances.", "CRISPR-Cas9 requires the insertion of foreign DNA into the organism, making it a form of GMO."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_biology"}
{"question": "What can be inferred from the population density formula (population density = total population / land area)?", "choices": ["A higher population density always indicates a better quality of life", "A country with a large land area will always have a low population density", "Population density does not account for uneven distribution of people within a region", "Population density is the most accurate measure of a country's economic strength"], "answer": "C", "subject": "high_school_geography"}
{"question": "Which statement is true about the impact of the Transcontinental Railroad on Native American tribes?", "choices": ["It led to increased cooperation between tribes and the U.S. government due to shared economic benefits.", "It accelerated the displacement and destruction of tribal lands and resources.", "It provided tribes with new opportunities for trade and cultural exchange with settlers.", "It resulted in the U.S. government granting permanent land rights to tribes along the railroad route."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_us_history"}
{"question": "In the context of the Scientific Revolution, which of the following best describes the primary contribution of Francis Bacon to the development of the scientific method?", "choices": ["He invented the telescope to observe celestial bodies", "He emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and inductive reasoning", "He formulated the heliocentric model of the solar system", "He discovered the laws of motion and universal gravitation"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_european_history"}
{"question": "What is the primary cause of the rapid industrialization in the United States during the late 19th century?", "choices": ["The decline of agricultural production", "The expansion of railroad networks and technological innovations", "The increase in European immigration", "The rise of labor unions"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_us_history"}
{"question": "What can be inferred from the observation that mitochondria contain their own DNA and ribosomes?", "choices": ["Mitochondria evolved from free-living bacteria through endosymbiosis.", "Mitochondria are capable of independent replication outside the host cell.", "Mitochondrial DNA is identical to nuclear DNA in sequence and function.", "Mitochondria primarily function in protein synthesis for the entire cell."], "answer": "A", "subject": "high_school_biology"}
{"question": "Which example illustrates the concept of cultural diffusion in world history?", "choices": ["The construction of the Great Wall of China", "The spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia", "The fall of the Roman Empire", "The invention of the printing press in Europe"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_world_history"}
{"question": "Identify the correct explanation for the practical implications of the Columbian Exchange on European diets.", "choices": ["It led to a decline in agricultural productivity due to soil depletion.", "It introduced new crops like potatoes and tomatoes, diversifying food sources.", "It caused widespread famine by replacing traditional crops with foreign ones.", "It reduced trade dependencies by making Europe self-sufficient in food production."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_world_history"}
{"question": "What can be inferred from the observation that mutations in the promoter region of the lac operon prevent lactose metabolism in E. coli, even in the presence of lactose?", "choices": ["The lac repressor protein is permanently bound to the operator", "RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription of the lac genes", "The lac operon structural genes are deleted", "Lactose cannot enter the bacterial cell"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_biology"}
