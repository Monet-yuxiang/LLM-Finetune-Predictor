{"question": "How does the phenomenon of hydrogen bonding in water molecules contribute to the unique properties of snowflakes?", "choices": ["It increases the density of ice, causing snowflakes to form hexagonal shapes", "It allows water molecules to arrange in a rigid lattice, leading to diverse crystalline structures", "It reduces the surface tension of water, enabling intricate branching patterns", "It prevents the formation of covalent bonds, resulting in symmetrical designs"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_chemistry"}
{"question": "Why does the scientific method in psychology prioritize falsifiability over verifiability when testing hypotheses?", "choices": ["Because verifiability requires larger sample sizes, making studies less feasible", "Because falsifiability allows hypotheses to be rigorously tested by attempting to disprove them", "Because verifiability is more subjective and prone to researcher bias", "Because falsifiability is easier to achieve with qualitative data"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_psychology"}
{"question": "In the context of the scientific method, why might a geographer analyze satellite images of deforestation over time?", "choices": ["To confirm pre-existing beliefs about forest growth", "To identify patterns and potential causes of deforestation", "To promote tourism in deforested areas", "To estimate the number of animals displaced by logging"], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_geography"}
{"question": "Which statement is true about the practical implications of price elasticity of demand in a monopolistically competitive market?", "choices": ["Firms can increase total revenue by raising prices if demand is elastic.", "Firms with inelastic demand can maximize profits by lowering production costs rather than adjusting prices.", "Price discrimination is ineffective because consumers have perfect information about substitutes.", "Advertising has no impact on the perceived differentiation of products in the long run."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_microeconomics"}
{"question": "Which of the following best describes the comparative impact of Wilhelm Wundt's structuralism and William James' functionalism on the development of modern psychology?", "choices": ["Structuralism laid the foundation for experimental methods, while functionalism was largely disregarded due to its lack of empirical focus.", "Structuralism emphasized the analysis of conscious experience, while functionalism focused on the purpose of behavior and mental processes, both influencing different branches of psychology.", "Functionalism dominated early psychology, while structuralism had little lasting impact beyond its initial popularity.", "Both structuralism and functionalism were quickly replaced by behaviorism, leaving no significant legacy in contemporary psychology."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_psychology"}
{"question": "Identify the correct explanation for the Three-Fifths Compromise in the U.S. Constitution.", "choices": ["It allowed three-fifths of a state's population to vote in federal elections.", "It counted three-fifths of the enslaved population for representation and taxation purposes.", "It required three-fifths of states to approve any new amendment to the Constitution.", "It divided the federal government's power into three branches, each with five key responsibilities."], "answer": "B", "subject": "high_school_us_history"}
