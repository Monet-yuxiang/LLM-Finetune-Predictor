This direct impact stalls local economic growth, with mature farms struggling to compete. Younger farmers argue these methods, like no-till farming, increase yields by 12-15%. The critical divide highlights a reluctance to adapt despite clear benefits.\nQuestion: What percentage of older farmers oppose sustainable methods in rural Iowa?"
