Local economies were disrupted as colonial powers imposed cash crops and extractive labor systems, often through coercion.

By controlling key ports like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, the Company not only monopolized commerce but also exerted indirect political influence over local rulers. This 'Company Raj' system weakened traditional Mughal and regional governance structures, replacing them with a profit-driven administration. The Company's tax collection methods, particularly the Permanent Settlement of 1793 in Bengal, tied land revenue to commercial interests, creating a landlord class loyal to British economic goals. This fusion of commerce and governance laid the groundwork for formal colonial rule after 1857.\nQuestion: What was the significance of the British East India Company's control over South Asian ports in reshaping political systems?"

The empire's millet system allowed religious minorities limited autonomy, preserving pre-Islamic legal customs among Christians and Jews. Meanwhile, Sufi orders like the Mevlevis integrated mystical Islam with local practices, creating syncretic cultural expressions. However, European trade dominance and internal decentralization weakened Ottoman economic control, leading to reliance on tax farming (iltizam) and tribal alliances.

This shift reflects broader patterns of social movements tied to ecological and economic pressures.\nQuestion: What were the main causes of Cahokia's decline in the 14th century?"

Educated in Western-style institutions yet deeply rooted in Hindu philosophy, Vivekananda's life (1863–1902) exemplified the struggle to reconcile Indian spiritual traditions with the demands of a rapidly modernizing society. His iconic 1893 speech at Chicago's Parliament of Religions positioned Vedanta as a 'universal religion,' appealing to both Indian nationalists and Western audiences. This period saw traditional gurukul education systems decline as English-medium schools spread, creating a cultural duality among the Bengali intelligentsia.\nQuestion: How did Swami Vivekananda's transnational activism impact the reinterpretation of Hindu traditions in colonial South Asia?"

Question: How did artistic achievement change from the early (500-900 CE) to late (900-1500 CE) Middle Ages in North America?"

In West Africa, British and French colonizers established schools to train clerks and low-level administrators, often excluding the masses. Meanwhile, in Ethiopia, Emperor Menelik II championed Western-style education to modernize the country, while preserving Amharic as the language of instruction. Southern Africa saw mission schools dominate, offering basic literacy but reinforcing racial hierarchies. Individual stories, like that of Nigerian nationalist Nnamdi Azikiwe, who studied in the U.S. after being denied higher education under British rule, highlight the disparities in access and quality.\nQuestion: How did access to formal education vary across African regions during the Modern Era (1800-1945)?"

In West Africa, the Mali Empire (13th-16th century) flourished under Mansa Musa, whose legendary hajj showcased Timbuktu as a center of Islamic learning and trade. Meanwhile, the Swahili city-states along the East African coast, like Kilwa and Mombasa, thrived on Indian Ocean trade, blending Bantu, Arab, and Persian influences. Politically, Mali centralized power under a Muslim ruler, while the Swahili states operated as semi-autonomous merchant oligarchies.
