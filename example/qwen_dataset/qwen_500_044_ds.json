This generational shift in natural geography threatens coastal communities with rising sea levels, potentially displacing millions by 2050. Medium-impact projections suggest a 0.5-meter rise globally, exacerbating flooding in vulnerable regions like Southeast Asia.\nQuestion: How much has the melting of Greenland's ice sheets accelerated in the past 20 years?\","
