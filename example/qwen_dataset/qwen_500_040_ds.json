For instance, a 2022 study showed that 60% of deforestation policies were rolled back during economic downturns. This human-nature conflict highlights the tension between immediate resource exploitation and ecological preservation. From a decision maker's view, the lack of enforcement mechanisms exacerbates the decline in policy effectiveness.\nQuestion: What percentage of deforestation policies were rolled back during economic downturns?"
