Their works often featured medieval themes, nature, and literary subjects, particularly from Shakespeare and Keats.

Coral bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, turning them white and making them more susceptible to disease. The 2020 bleaching event was the most widespread on record, affecting 25% of the reef.

Known for their elaborate palace complexes like Knossos, the Minoans developed a sophisticated trade network across the Mediterranean, exporting pottery, textiles, and saffron. They used a unique writing system called Linear A, which remains undeciphered. The civilization's decline is often attributed to the eruption of Thera (modern Santorini) around 1600 BCE, which caused massive tsunamis and ashfall. Minoan art is renowned for its vibrant frescoes depicting dolphins, bull-leaping rituals, and nature scenes.\nQuestion: What was the likely cause of the Minoan civilization's decline?"

The ceremony emphasizes harmony ('wa'), respect ('kei'), purity ('sei'), and tranquility ('jaku'). Participants follow strict etiquette, including specific seating arrangements, bowing, and the handling of utensils. The tea room, or 'chashitsu,' is designed with simplicity and natural materials, often featuring a 'tokonoma' alcove displaying a scroll or seasonal flower arrangement.

Harold's army, exhausted from a previous battle against the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge, faced William's well-disciplined cavalry and archers.

Known for its advanced city planning, the civilization featured grid-patterned streets, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. Major cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa had populations of up to 40,000 people. The civilization engaged in extensive trade with Mesopotamia, exporting goods like cotton, ivory, and beads. Despite its advancements, the script of the Indus Valley remains undeciphered, and the reasons for its decline around 1900 BCE—possibly due to climate change or river shifts—are still debated by historians.\nQuestion: What were two key architectural features of the Indus Valley Civilization's cities?"

This breakthrough revolutionized medicine by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections that were previously fatal. By World War II, penicillin was mass-produced, saving countless lives on the battlefield. The discovery earned Fleming the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945, shared with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, who developed methods for large-scale production. Penicillin's success led to the development of other antibiotics, fundamentally changing modern medicine.\nQuestion: What accidental observation led to the discovery of penicillin?"

It created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now part of the World Bank Group. The system pegged currencies to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold at $35 per ounce. This arrangement provided stability until 1971 when President Nixon ended dollar-gold convertibility, leading to floating exchange rates. The Bretton Woods institutions continue to play key roles in global financial governance, with the IMF focusing on monetary cooperation and the World Bank on development financing.\nQuestion: What was the fixed exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and gold under the Bretton Woods system?"

Unlike earlier models, GPT-3 could perform a wide range of tasks—from writing essays to coding—with minimal fine-tuning, showcasing the power of large-scale machine learning. Its implications for future AI development include: (1) accelerating progress in few-shot and zero-shot learning, (2) raising ethical concerns about misuse (e.g., deepfake text and misinformation), and (3) shifting research focus toward even larger models and efficient training methods. GPT-3 also highlighted the need for robust safety measures as AI systems become more autonomous and human-like in their outputs."
