In 2016 and 2017, back-to-back mass bleaching events affected over 50% of the reef's coral. Additionally, ocean acidification, caused by increased CO2 absorption, weakens coral skeletons, making them more vulnerable to damage. The reef supports over 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral, but its biodiversity is under threat from these environmental changes.\nQuestion: What percentage of the Great Barrier Reef's coral was affected by the mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017?"
