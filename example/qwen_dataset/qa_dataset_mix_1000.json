The reef's biodiversity, which includes 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral, is under threat from ocean acidification, pollution, and coastal development. Conservation efforts, such as the Reef 2050 Plan, aim to reduce these impacts.\nQuestion: What percentage of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by coral bleaching during the 2016 and 2017 events?"

The reef supports over 1,500 species of fish and 400 types of coral, but its biodiversity is under threat from these environmental changes.\nQuestion: What percentage of the Great Barrier Reef's coral was affected by the mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017?"
