Indigenous populations faced displacement, disease, and cultural disruption, while European settlers established new social hierarchies. The introduction of African slaves further diversified the population, creating a complex, often violent, multicultural society. Economic demands, such as the fur trade and plantation agriculture, drove these changes, intertwining the fates of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. The resulting societal shifts laid the groundwork for modern North American demographics and racial dynamics.\nQuestion: What were the main causes of the societal transformations in North America during the Early Modern period?"

The British Empire relied heavily on coal from domestic mines, fueling its factories and railways, while Germany, lacking sufficient coal deposits, turned to lignite (brown coal) and later invested in hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, France prioritized agricultural exports like wine and grain, trading them for raw materials from its colonies. These differing approaches created distinct environmental impacts—Britain's coal-heavy industry led to severe urban pollution, whereas Germany's shift to hydroelectricity reduced local emissions but required extensive dam construction.\nQuestion: What were the differences between Britain's and Germany's primary energy sources during industrialization (1800-1945)?"

By the mid-19th century, European powers imposed extractive systems—forcing cash crops (cotton, rubber) and mineral extraction (gold, diamonds) for export, disrupting traditional economies. Infrastructure like railways was built to serve colonial interests, not local development. By 1945, Africa was deeply integrated into global capitalism but with economies skewed toward resource exploitation, leaving little industrial base.\nQuestion: How did economic production in Africa change from the pre-colonial period (before 1800) to the height of colonialism (1945)?"

They introduced the 'Amatya' system—a council of ministers representing diverse regions—while allowing feudatories like the Gangas and Alupas to govern peripheries. This balance of power enabled survival against Harsha's expansion (606-647 CE) and Arab incursions (712 CE).
